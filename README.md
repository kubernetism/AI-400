## Cloud-Native AI — Learn Dapr, Docker &amp; Kubernetes with AIDD
The way we build and run AI is changing. It’s no longer just about running agents on your laptop—it’s about deploying intelligent systems that live and scale in the cloud. Cloud-Native AI gives you the skills to do exactly that: take your AI projects from local experiments to production-grade systems.

In this course, you’ll learn how to build cloud infrastructure for AI agents using Specification-Driven Development and AI-Driven Development (AIDD). You’ll start with FastAPI and Docker, packaging your applications into portable containers. Then move to Kubernetes, learning how to run and manage those containers at scale. Finally, you’ll explore Dapr, the layer that makes your AI systems cloud-agnostic, with built-in support for state management, pub/sub messaging, and service communication. Each step is practical and hands-on.

You’ll containerize real AI apps, deploy agent systems on Kubernetes, and use Dapr to connect everything together—without locking yourself to a single cloud provider. By the end, you’ll know how to build, deploy, and manage AI agents that scale automatically, recover gracefully, and run anywhere. This course turns developers into cloud thinkers—people who don’t just code AI, but design the systems that make AI work in the real world.
